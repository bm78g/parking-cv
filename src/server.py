# I forgot I set up the REST API for EventBridge to
# trigger the CV computation via an API call, so reinstating this

# I initially thought about running this entire application through AWS lambda,
# but eventually thought against it in favor of a long-running server

# The general architecture:
# Camera system -> triggers event + adds image to S3
#   -> EventBridge calls /api/compute -> this program retrieves image from S3
#       -> Computes image -> Uploads result to DynamoDB -> API Backend serves

# This server could've provided the JSON data itself, but decided
# against it in favor of decoupling systems
